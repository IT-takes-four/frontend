- Always use React Server Components (RSC) and latest Next.js features. 
- Use client components sparingly, only when interactivity is required.
- Take advantage of Next.js file-based routing system for simplicity.
- Centralize shared layouts in `layout.tsx` for consistency across pages.
- Add `loading.tsx` to handle loading states for better UX (only if the component is client-side).
- Implement custom error pages with `error.tsx` to handle errors gracefully.
- Use API route handlers to manage backend logic within the app structure.
- Optimize server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for faster loading times.
- Use Tanstack query for fetching endpoints from API.
- All API routes are located at app/api folder.
